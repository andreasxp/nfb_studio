class JSONDecoder(json.JSONDecoder):
    """JSON decoder that provides tools to deserialize custom objects.

    You can add support for deserializing your class in two ways:  
    - By adding a member function to your class: `def deserialize(self, data: dict)`;
    - By adding an external function `def deserialize(obj, data: dict)` and passing it in a dict as the `hooks`
      parameter. (`hooks` is a dict that matches a class to a deserialization function.) This parameter also can accept
      a Hooks object or a tuple of two dicts: a serialization dict and a deserialization dict (the latter is ignored).

    When deserializing an object, this decoder first looks up the metadata field left by the JSONEncoder. If that
    field exists, the decoder default-constructs an instance of a class that was encoded. It then checks if the class
    instance has a function in `hooks` or has a callable `deserialize()` attribute. If that is the case, the dict
    read from json is passed to that function to allow the class instance to load the contents into itself. Functions in
    the `hooks` parameter take precedence over member functions.

    JSONDecoder does not accept an `object_hook` or `object_pairs_hook` parameter from JSONDecoder.

    .. note::
        If the metadata `__class__` field does not exist, the decoder leaves the dictionary as-is. If the field exists
        but was corrupted in some way, an exception will be raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hooks : dict, tuple, or Hooks object (default: None)
            A dict, mapping types to functions that can be used to deserialize them in the format
            `def foo(obj, data: dict)`, a tuple containing such dict as its element 1, or a `hooks.Hooks` object;
        parse_float : callable (default: None)
            If specified, will be called with the string of every JSON float to be decoded. By default, this is
            equivalent to float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser for JSON floats
            (e.g. decimal.Decimal).
        parse_int : callable (default: None)
            If specified, will be called with the string of every JSON int to be decoded. By default, this is equivalent
            to int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser for JSON integers (e.g. float).
        parse_constant : callable (default: None)
            If specified, will be called with one of the following strings: '-Infinity', 'Infinity', 'NaN'. This can be
            used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers are encountered.
        strict : bool (default: True)
            If False, then control characters will be allowed inside strings. Control characters in this context are
            those with character codes in the 0â€“31 range, including '\t' (tab), '\n', '\r' and '\0'.

            An internal function. This method is used as an object_hook to initialize JSONDecoder. It looks for a meta
            field called `__class__` as a marker that the json field should be deserialized as an object. It attempts to
            default-construct an instance of the specified class and call either a method from the hooks dict or

            ------

                If no class specified by the encoder exists in the module specified by the encoder.

                If the specified class exists but is not default-constructible;
                If the specified class was constructed but its deserialize method accepts something other than a single

            AttributeError
                If the specified class was constructed, but it has no callable deserialize method.
